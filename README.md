This is a simple Java Spring Boot application.
Java 11 JDK was used for developing this application.
The application was developed using IntelliJ IDE.
The main services are placed in the main 'Application.java' class.
The application works as a command prompt application.
It is possible to clone the application from the BitBucket then
open it in the IntelliJ IDE and run it. It is possible to try
application services separately - the application will work,
but results will be poor - there will be no test data created.
